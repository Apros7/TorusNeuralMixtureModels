Introduction to problem + solution

## Set-up
We chose to use [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to automate our processes and improve ease-of-use when using our repo. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows) to install on windows or use ```brew install make``` if you're on a macbook.

First, run these commands to setup the project:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make
```

Then, run the tests to make sure the software works as expected:
```
make test
```
