## Script for creating synthetic data as described in [Klein2020]

## We need to make a script for creating synthetic data outside of Torus Graphs
## And another script for sampling in Torus Graphs.

from typing import List, Tuple

def sampleFromTorusGraph(nodes : int, samples : int, nodepairs : List[Tuple[int, int]]):
    # 
    pass

def sampleOutsideOfTorusGraph():
    drawVonMises()
    pass

def drawVonMises():
